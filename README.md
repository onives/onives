- 👋 Hi,안녕 ! I’m Olive Nives Nameere. A self-taught lady dev. It's nice to meet you!
- .. My friends call me Nives. Outside coding/work, I love to dance (Afro-Latin to be more specific) and watch series especially kdramas.
- I have built full stack apps with React.js, Express.js, CSS, MongoDB. Tested web apps with Selenium, Pytest
- 👀 I’m interested in solving problems with Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Test Driven Development (TDD) with Rspec, Ruby & Rails and I'm in love with it 💞️ Not to worry, I have a big heart & there's extra room for more technologies :)
- Soon diving into Machine Learning.
